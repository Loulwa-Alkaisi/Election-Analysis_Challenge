# ***Election_Analysis_Challenge***
## **Overview:**
In this challenge we were helping Tom in creating an election audit for the results of the U.S. congressional precinct in the state of Colorado. In this audit we reported the total number of votes, total number of votes for each candidate, percentage votes for each candidate, the winner of the election, and the largest county turnout.

## **Election-Audit Summary:**
The results mentioned above in the text and in the election-audit allows the election commission to use them to find out which counties had more voters, who won the election, and compare the results of each candidates. The script can also be modified to be used in other elections to compare how every candidate performed in each county and this script can, with some modifications, also be helpful in studying larger number of counties and candidates.
